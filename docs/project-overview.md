# 📄 Project Overview

## Document Chatbot with RAG + Pinecone + Streamlit

### 🎯 Purpose

This project is a powerful web-based chatbot application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and ask questions about their contents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pinecone vector database and OpenAI GPT-4.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-format Document Support**: Upload PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
- **Intelligent Q&A**: Ask questions about your documents using natural language
- **Advanced RAG Pipeline**: Combines document retrieval with AI generation
- **Vector Search**: Powered by Pinecone for fast and accurate document search
- **Session Management**: Maintain conversation context and history
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient batch processing for embeddings
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit web interface
- **Configurable Settings**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in RAG tracing and metrics collection
- **LangChain Integration**: Advanced agent capabilities for complex queries
- **Command System**: Special commands for system operations

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Frontend** | Streamlit | Web-based user interface |
| **Backend** | Python | Core application logic |
| **LLM** | OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5 | Natural language generation |
| **Embeddings** | OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 | Document vectorization |
| **Vector Database** | Pinecone | Similarity search and storage |
| **Document Processing** | PyMuPDF, python-docx | File parsing and text extraction |
| **Framework** | LangChain | LLM orchestration and RAG pipeline |
| **Configuration** | Pydantic | Type-safe configuration management |
| **Monitoring** | LangSmith | Optional tracing and observability |

### 🎯 Use Cases

- **Legal Document Review**: Upload contracts and ask specific questions
- **Research Analysis**: Upload research papers and get summaries
- **Knowledge Management**: Create a searchable knowledge base
- **Study Assistant**: Upload textbooks and ask study questions
- **Business Intelligence**: Analyze reports and extract insights
- **Technical Documentation**: Query API docs and manuals

### 🔍 How It Works

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload documents through the Streamlit interface
2. **Text Extraction**: Documents are parsed and text content is extracted
3. **Chunking**: Text is split into manageable chunks with overlap
4. **Embedding**: Each chunk is converted to vector embeddings using OpenAI
5. **Storage**: Embeddings are stored in Pinecone with metadata
6. **Query Processing**: User questions are embedded and used to search similar chunks
7. **Response Generation**: Retrieved chunks provide context for GPT-4 to generate answers

### 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer**: Streamlit UI components
- **Application Layer**: Main application logic, session management, command routing
- **Processing Layer**: File parsing, text chunking, embedding generation, RAG agents
- **Data Access Layer**: Pinecone client, session storage, RAG tracing
- **Configuration Layer**: Pydantic-based configuration management
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Error handling, logging, and performance decorators

### 🔒 Security Features

- Environment variable-based configuration
- API key validation
- File size and type restrictions
- Session-based data isolation
- Input validation and sanitization

### 📊 Performance Features

### 🎛️ Configuration Options

The application supports extensive configuration through environment variables:

- **OpenAI Settings**: Model selection, temperature, API keys, base URL
- **Embedding Settings**: Model selection, batch size, API configuration
- **Pinecone Settings**: Index configuration, environment, dimension, metric
- **Chunking Parameters**: Chunk size, overlap, separators
- **RAG Parameters**: Top-k retrieval, similarity thresholds, max context chunks
- **File Upload Limits**: Size restrictions, allowed extensions, max files per session
- **Session Settings**: Timeout, data directory
- **LangSmith Integration**: Optional tracing and monitoring
