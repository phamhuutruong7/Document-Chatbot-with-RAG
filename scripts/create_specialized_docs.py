• NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti: $400, 1440p capable, future-proof

Used/Refurbished Options:
• GTX 1660 Super: $120-150, solid 1080p performance
• RTX 3060: $200-250, ray tracing, 12GB VRAM
• RX 6600: $180-220, excellent 1080p, low power

GPU Considerations:
• Used market can offer excellent value
• Consider power consumption and PSU requirements
• Ray tracing vs raw performance trade-offs
• VRAM amount for future games

Memory for Budget Builds:
Capacity Recommendations:
• 8GB minimum for basic computing
• 16GB sweet spot for gaming and productivity
• 32GB only for content creation or professional work

Speed Considerations:
• DDR4-3200 minimum for AMD Ryzen
• DDR4-3600 optimal for most systems
• DDR5 for future builds, higher cost currently
• Timing impact minimal for budget builds

Budget Memory Strategy:
• Start with 1x8GB, upgrade to 2x8GB later
• Prioritize capacity over speed in budget builds
• Ensure motherboard supports desired speeds
• Check QVL for compatibility

Storage for Budget Builds:
Primary Storage:
• 250GB SSD minimum for OS and essential programs
• 500GB SSD recommended for gaming
• NVMe preferred over SATA for speed
• Quality matters more than pure speed

Secondary Storage:
• 1TB HDD for mass storage if needed
• External drives for backup
• Cloud storage for important files
• Upgrade storage as budget allows

Storage Strategy:
• Start with SSD-only setup
• Add HDD later for mass storage
• Prioritize SSD space for frequently used programs
• Monitor storage usage and upgrade accordingly

BUDGET BUILD STRATEGIES
----------------------

Upgrade Path Planning:
Phase 1 - Essential Build:
• Basic components for immediate needs
• Integrated graphics or entry GPU
• Minimum viable RAM
• Quality PSU with upgrade headroom

Phase 2 - Performance Upgrade:
• Add discrete graphics card
• Increase RAM to 16GB
• Add more storage
• Improve cooling if needed

Phase 3 - Future Enhancement:
• Upgrade to higher-tier GPU
• Add more storage or upgrade to faster
• Enhance cooling system
• Consider CPU upgrade if bottlenecked

Component Prioritization:
Never Compromise On:
• Power supply quality and wattage
• Motherboard basic features and compatibility
• SSD for primary storage
• Case airflow and cable management

Acceptable Budget Compromises:
• Entry-level CPU cooler (upgrade later)
• Single channel RAM (add second stick later)
• Basic case (upgrade for aesthetics later)
• Integrated graphics initially

Money-Saving Strategies:
• Buy during sales events (Black Friday, etc.)
• Consider open-box and refurbished items
• Mix new and used components strategically
• Bundle deals for peripherals
• Mail-in rebates and cashback offers

USED COMPONENT BUYING
--------------------

Safe Used Component Categories:
Low Risk:
• Cases (check for damage and included accessories)
• Monitors (test thoroughly for dead pixels)
• Keyboards and mice (clean and test all functions)
• Speakers and basic peripherals

Medium Risk:
• CPUs (rarely fail, check pins on AMD)
• RAM (test thoroughly, check for stability)
• Storage drives (check SMART data and health)
• Power supplies (check age and warranty)

Higher Risk:
• Graphics cards (check for mining damage)
• Motherboards (many failure points)
• Liquid cooling (check for leaks and age)

Used Component Inspection:
Physical Inspection:
• Check for physical damage
• Look for burn marks or discoloration
• Verify all connectors present
• Check for bent pins or damaged slots

Testing Procedures:
• Stress test GPUs before buying
• Run memory tests on used RAM
• Check storage health with diagnostic tools
• Verify all ports and features work

Warranty Considerations:
• Check remaining manufacturer warranty
• Understand return policies
• Consider extended protection plans
• Document condition upon receipt

BUDGET BUILDING TIPS
-------------------

Tool Requirements:
Essential Tools:
• Phillips head screwdriver (magnetic tip preferred)
• Anti-static wrist strap (optional but recommended)
• Zip ties for cable management
• Thermal paste (usually included with cooler)

Free Software Tools:
• Ninite for easy software installation
• MSI Afterburner for GPU monitoring
• HWiNFO64 for system monitoring
• Steam for game library management

Cost-Saving Assembly Tips:
• Take time with cable management (improves airflow)
• Install motherboard standoffs correctly
• Apply thermal paste properly (pea-sized amount)
• Check all connections before first boot

Common Budget Build Mistakes:
Avoid These Errors:
• Cheaping out on power supply
• Buying incompatible RAM
• Insufficient PSU wattage for upgrades
• Poor case airflow planning
• Forgetting Windows license cost

Planning Mistakes:
• Not considering peripherals in budget
• Ignoring shipping costs and taxes
• Unrealistic performance expectations
• Poor upgrade path planning

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
-----------------------

Free Performance Gains:
BIOS/UEFI Settings:
• Enable XMP/DOCP for RAM
• Update to latest BIOS version
• Enable PCI Express generation
• Configure fan curves for optimal cooling

Windows Optimization:
• Disable unnecessary startup programs
• Enable High Performance power plan
• Update all drivers to latest versions
• Disable Windows animations for older hardware

Software Optimization:
• Use MSI Afterburner for GPU overclocking
• Monitor temperatures during stress testing
• Clean install Windows for best performance
• Regular system maintenance and cleanup

Budget Overclocking:
Safe Overclocking:
• Start with GPU memory overclocking
• Gradually increase core clocks
• Monitor temperatures closely
• Test stability with gaming or benchmarks

RAM Overclocking:
• Enable XMP profiles first
• Manually tune timings if experienced
• Stress test for stability
• Monitor for system crashes

Cooling on a Budget:
• Good case airflow more important than expensive coolers
• Additional case fans cost-effective upgrade
• Proper cable management improves airflow
• Regular dust cleaning maintains performance

FUTURE UPGRADE PLANNING
----------------------

Upgrade Priority Order:
1. Graphics Card (biggest gaming performance impact)
2. RAM capacity (8GB to 16GB significant improvement)
3. Storage (add more SSD space or upgrade to NVMe)
4. CPU (when becoming bottleneck for GPU)
5. Peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse improvements)

Budget for Upgrades:
Annual Upgrade Budget:
• Set aside $100-200 per year for upgrades
• Prioritize based on actual performance needs
• Take advantage of sales and discounts
• Consider selling old components to fund upgrades

Performance Monitoring:
Track These Metrics:
• Frame rates in games you play
• System responsiveness in daily tasks
• Temperature levels under load
• Storage space utilization
• RAM usage during multitasking

When to Upgrade:
Graphics Card:
• Consistently below 60 FPS in desired games
• Unable to run new games at acceptable settings
• Ray tracing desired for enhanced visuals

RAM:
• High memory usage (>80%) during normal tasks
• System slowdown when multitasking
• Browser tabs causing memory warnings

Storage:
• Running low on space (<20% free)
• Slow loading times for programs and games
• Desire for additional storage capacity
